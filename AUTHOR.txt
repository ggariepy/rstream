About the author:
=================
My name is Geoff Gariepy, and I live in the Detroit, Michigan, USA metropolitan area.  

I write and maintain software for a living.

If you want to contact me, my email address is geoff.gariepy@gmail.com

If you are making use of this software, it would be nice of you to tell me
how you are using it and in which country/region you sit while writing your code.  

If you are feeling generous, want to encourage my efforts, or are compelled by 
your OCD to arrange it so your bank account's current balance is a nice, round
number, you can send me the local price of a beer, coffee or soft drink to
the email address above via Paypal.  Feel free to suggest what beverage, exactly,
you had in mind.  I might even try it.
